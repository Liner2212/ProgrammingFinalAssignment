# Bug List - Final Project

**carolina Malmros:**
**:**

Put this file in `Assets/Documentation/`. Required at Beta (Wednesday Nov 11).
Write a bug down the moment you see it. Fix the worst ones first.

## How to Write a Bug
What I did -> What happened -> What I expected.
> Example: "Pressed Esc during the last 10 seconds -> the timer kept counting -> the timer should stop when I pause."

## Fix Order
1. Stops the game (crash, can't start, can't win or lose, stuck)
2. Breaks a G requirement
3. Confuses a tester
4. Polish

Happens every time, or in the first 30 seconds? Move it up one level.
Test every fix in the Windows build, not just in the editor.

## My Bugs

| # | What I did -> What happened -> What I expected | How often | Found by | Order (1-4) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pressed Esc during the last 10 seconds -> the timer kept counting -> it should stop | Every time | Me | 2 | Fixed |
| 2 |Changed update to fixed update |jump wasnt being recognized |it to run smoothly |kept not recognizing it |me |fixed, changed back to up
| 3 |Ghost walls |re- doing script because did not feel like I got it | The walls to disappear with G|Player sprite disappearing instead |me | unresolved

How often: every time / sometimes / once. Found by: me / a tester.
Status: Fixed / Will fix / Won't fix (because ___).
"Won't fix" is a real answer. Studios ship with known bugs every time. Just write why.
